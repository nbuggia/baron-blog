I'll want to respond to these somehow:

##Dealing with Change as a PM

Change can be scary, change can be fun, change is an imperative for humanity, can be wearisome, change can incomprehensible but the ability to manage change is vital when you live in a business environment where business as normal means rapid adaptation to a number of factors including industry dynamics, partner needs, competitors making advances, government and consumer policy changes and a host of other important and varied reasons.

In order to stay competitive, we must be able to adapt our plans and continue to execute and deliver great innovation to our customers.

I'm really proud of our culture here in the Bing team - we are competitive, we are adaptive, we value product design and we make strong data-driven decisions and we are an all-around execution machine. We have worked hard to become an asset for the company and it's more important than ever to maintain our culture. Change is a core part of our culture, but even so we can learn and grow as a team.

Today, Qi announced our annual update to the OSD Strategy memo, and if have had a chance to read it, you will see that we are in a time of great change for Microsoft. The company is going through a fundamental transformation with the emergence of vertically integrated devices which requires close cooperation across the company to pull our assets together. Our Sodium planning set us up well to align to this strategy, particularly with our increased investment in Windows. And while the org has begun adapting to this new model we still have more tuning to do to ensure we integrate well across Microsoft as a platform and still maintain our culture. A lot of this will come down to communication and I'll be working with you on that over the coming weeks to continue to communicate vision, strategy, positioning and how it impacts our PM team.

I'll be relying on managers more than ever to help us steer toward success. Because of this I wanted to start a dialog with you on managing change.

I will give some suggestions below, but as a way to illustrate my points below, let me give you all a tangible example of managing change for the Windows Blue project. I could choose any project but this one is current and it is complex and new so it's a great example.

With the increased investment in Windows, and our bet for Windows Blue, we're in the middle of a big change for the Bing team and many of your employees are experiencing this change personally. The user experience is changing, the ranking models may change, our revenue model may change, the global footprint of our product is changing at rapid pace, we are partnering for the final solution with a new team, we are building a new serving pipeline, the metrics will change and the list goes on and on!

There is a lot of new work, and therefore change is inevitable.

Perhaps your employee has been working on a core feature for the last 6 months or more and the team they've been working with has gelled. They are all working hard toward a common goal of shipping that feature and creating a backlog for the next release and now we're asking that they shift to help work on Blue. We can see the huge opportunity but how will they feel about this change?

This change will be unsettling for any number of reasons: they are attached to their feature, there are too many unknowns to get excited about the new feature or they don't understand or agree with the strategy direction. Change can be personal; they may be fearful of working on something new and even question whether they'll be able to maintain the same high performance level. The ways employees react in time of change vary from employee to employee. Over the years I've seen strong aversions to change, blaming, working hard to justify their feature (which isn't always negative if done in a constructive way). I've also seen employees get angry and even make rash career decisions. While the employee behaviors are generally normal they aren't always healthy for the org, especially when the reactions are drawn out. As a manager you can help your employees navigate periods of change and minimize the effects on them and the org.

One of the key elements of the change management process is the communication strategy and that's what I want to focus on in this post.

What to communicate: The first thing I encourage you to do is to make sure you understand what's changing for you and your team and the reasoning for it. If you don't understand how the change affects your team or why it's happening, ask your manager and if they don't understand keep going until somebody does. That means you will get to me at some point, and if I don't know I will certainly reach out to Qi and ask. Don't hesitate to ask – I want and need you informed. It's a core role of a manager to ensure we're communicating change effectively, and personally, I rely on all of you to speak up when something isn't landing well so we can work together to resolve it. Once you understand the changes, communicate them to your employees. Your employees will wonder, "what does this mean for me?" and you should be able to answer that. If you can't, work to provide clarity as quickly as possible.
When to communicate: The time chosen to communicate change could make the difference between successful transition and a failed attempt. You should communicate change as early as possible, but you also need to be prepared with the right amount of information. There will be questions which you can't answer and its fine to get back to your employees at a later date, however if the majority of questions go unanswered it can do more harm than good. Holding information back while you get more clarity is sometimes the right thing to do so your team can keep executing, but if rumors are going around you might need to communicate sooner than you'd like. This is an art so the more you are tapped in to your team's grapevine the better you'll be at gauging the timing.
How to communicate: Change should be communicated multiple times and through various means before you should expect your team to fully internalize it. I learned a long time ago that repeat communication is very important so keep communicating the same message over and over. Broad org emails is one method, all hands, team meetings, brownbags, 1:1s, etc… As managers, we should all be aligned and delivering the same overall message, with each forum helping cement the messages and adding more context each time. I would argue that in times of change, delivering messages in a 1:1 setting is the most important. Research shows that people under stress can lose as much as 80% of their ability to process information. This 1:1 meeting makes it safe for employees to ask questions, clarify their doubts and raise any concerns they may have.
Cynics and Change Leaders: This last one is important. Remember your leadership role. If you are cynical about the change and you communicate with your team, the chances are high that your team will pick up on it and become cynical as well. This spreads negativity through the org, making it that much harder to get everyone moving in the same direction. Conversely, change leaders are members enthused by the change who share it with others and spread positivity. If you are in a cynical stage of the change process, please do what you need to do to get through it as quickly as possible and in the meantime don't spread negativity. Don't be afraid to ask your manager for help. Many times if your cynical it may be because you haven't been exposed to all the information and that's all you need to get on board and become a change leader.
The management team here at Bing are world class, and I've seen time and time again that managers who take the time to first understand and then bring their employees along sets themselves and their team up for success.

As always, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

##Working with the press

I've received great feedback on the blog so far, and one of the topics I've been asked to write about it how we work with the press.

To be successful as a PM we must work closely and collaboratively with other functions outside of engineering: Marketing, HR, Finance, Legal, Business Development and Sales. We should all know how to partner with these functions and what their role is in our collective success. I'll label these posts "Know the Business". To kick this section off I'd like to write about a topic that's top of mind; briefing the press.

PR and Marketing's role: 
The PR team at Bing is part of marketing and they manage the interface between our product and the industry. We have an excellent PR team here in OSD and they perform an essential service for the product. The marketing team creates our brand positioning: "Bing is for doing" and then a value prop for a big campaign like compete, "People choose Bing web search results nearly 2 to 1 in blind comparison tests". All of our features which are within the compete umbrella would then roll up to this value prop. The positioning and value props are created from user research which determine the messages that resonate with our target audience. They are important to know because whenever you talk to the press you want your feature to snap to the correct messaging. It's your north star if you will and you can keep referring back to it. A good resource for this information is http://bingready.

Who is 'the press'?
The press is essentially made up of journalists that are all looking for stories. But the stories each journalist is interested in varies by their audience type (e.g. tech), their personal expertise, and size of the audience. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the audience, the more general the message needs to be to resonate. For example, a blogger might have 2,000 technical search engine readers and be interested in a story about our speller update while a national tv network might have 15 million and only be interested in a story as large as a Facebook privacy issue. There's a subset of the press we call influentials. They are generally bloggers who are amplifiers of messages; many other bloggers & press will pick up their stories and run with them. Danny Sullivan from SearchEngineLand and Kara Swisher from All Things Digital are two of the larger influentials for our industry but there are many others who write stories about search engines and Bing in particular that we need to be aware of.

The difference between proactive and reactive PR: 
When we want to generate awareness and trial of Bing or a particular feature, we'll proactively engage the press with a message and a specific goal of sticking to it and landing that message. You don't want to sound like a robot so don't repeat the same words over and over but know the core of what you need to convey and don't veer from it. An example of proactive messaging we use often for campaigns like Bing it On is: "Microsoft has more than doubled its search share since launching Bing, and Bing is now used by more than 220 million people each month worldwide. We've made solid progress and now power over 25% of all US searches (comScore, December 2012). Our expectation is that as people compare the quality of web search results head-to-head, they'll learn that they often prefer results from Bing over Google. We expect this, and our other unique features, will help us earn more use." When we don't want to proactively message something but need to be prepared in case the press reaches out to us for comment, we'll craft a reactive press statement. An example of this is when we decommissioned the Finance Vertical last August. The reactive message was: "As part of our continued effort to bring rich content into the main search results page, customers will see more of the structured data formerly in 2nd and 3rd page experiences show up in the main results page. As a result, some of those experiences will be retired. In the case of finance, we have great deep content on MSN that can help Bing provide a great finance search experience to customers." Sometimes the most dangerous kind of PR is when a journalist reaches out to us for a story; they generally have an angle in mind and are looking for a quote to support their story. If you are approached for a comment, make sure you engage the PR team before having a conversation.

Everything is on the record. 
Think carefully about your responses. You may say something with the best intentions which is taken out of context. So take your time and think through why they're asking the question and what they might be trying to get you to say before you answer. The press won't quote that you took too much time to respond to a question or said nothing, but they will quote you if you say the wrong thing. Respond to questions as concisely as possible. Long, complicated answers are confusing and easy to misinterpret. You don't need to answer every question because it's the polite thing to do, it's ok to say no or I'm not willing to disclose that information. And finally, what you share with your social network is public information so be careful about disclosing product information with your friends on Facebook or followers on Twitter - it might be taken out of context so please be careful!

Never speculate. Stick to what you know. 
The press may ask for your opinion on competitive products and technology, for example, "can you comment on Facebook's architecture?". Don't get sucked in to this. Stick to what you know and can control, which is Bing's feature set in the present time so redirect the conversation back to Bing and your messaging. If they ask you about future Bing plans & strategy you can say, "I'm not willing to disclose that information at present".

I didn't cover speaking on panels at conferences, I'd be interested to hear from those of you who do that and any tips you'd like to share with the team.

As always the feedback and discussion is helpful, so let me know if you have comments.



## PM SKILLS

RELATING TO OTHERS

You are all aware of our formal org structure and the usual ways of communicating: scrums, sharepoint, status mails, team meetings, etc… To operate in the formal organization, the emphasis is on things like feature team alignment, org hierarchy, rhythm of the business, and execution. Those are great tools for people to communicate and keep up to date.

But in any company there's also a hidden, informal organization that is built on personal relationships. Think of this informal organization as a grapevine of information that flows through people in every direction of the org; up, down, & sideways. If you remember the 80's you've heard the term, "I heard it through the grapevine". Well in all seriousness there's a lot to this phrase. The grapevine that runs through our org is a powerful network that carries information from person to person in hallways, during side conversations at the end of a meeting, by the coffee machine, and on social networks to name a few. Through this network you're likely to get information faster and with more context than you would otherwise. You'll also be able to leverage it to influence, manage through conflict, and accomplish many other things more efficiently. Since the grapevine is people based communication, you will be able to fully capitalize when you are adept at building and maintaining relationships.

This may seem to be an odd topic for a blog on being a great PM but bear with me!

I like to say that 50% of being a great PM is about relationships. As it turns out, relating with people is also tied to your income. According to research done by Dale Carnegie, the author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" your ability to relate to people is correlated to your financial success. So if you want to be a better PM and eventually move up, this is an area I can't stress the importance of enough.

The reason I chose to put Relate in Be a Great PM is because it took me a while to realize the power of the informal organization and the importance of relating, yet I was still good at my job. I received some great feedback and mentoring over the years that helped me develop as a PM and a big part of that came when I focused on improving my relationship skills. Instead of reading books about this topic, I chose to observe people and learn through others. According to the Myers Briggs test I am an introvert, so I tend to like working on things on my own, and creating new ideas through quiet contemplation. That required me to learn new approaches in this area. I learned that if you engage in enough social situations and make an effort to learn something new about yourself and others in the process, you improve as a PM (and it helps in your personal life too!). Some simple things you can do to practice is to engage in friendly debates, join a club, practice active listening (your significant other will love this one), or throw a dinner party. As I've said in previous blogs, growing as a PM can be acheived inside and outside the office. We can always learn from any situation. 

This is not meant to be a comprehensive view, and there are many great publications on this topic, but I thought I would jot down a few things I've learned over the years that have been helpful to me in this area.

Find common ground. It might sound simple but it's amazing how easy this step is. A great way to start a new working relationship is to find something you have in common with the other person. People are naturally drawn to others with similarities. Your similarity could be tech related; maybe you both dislike a new Google feature. Or it could be more personal, like you know somebody from the town they grew up in. Or something small like you both come to work early to avoid traffic. I find that PMs who know a little bit about a lot of things are able to find common ground with just about anybody. My wife loves to watch singing contests like American Idol and The Voice and most times I'd rather be working (truth be told I usually multi-task) but I can't tell you how many times I'm able to use those shows in conversations. Someone might say, "Did you see Christina Aguilera on the The Voice last night?". Now I'm not proposing you go out and watch Keeping up with the Kardashians or Jersey Shore marathons this weekend but you never know when a little pop culture will work itself into a conversation so keep an open mind.
Empathy is an incredible asset. Empathy is one of the most critical aspects of relating with others. It is defined as understanding what another person is feeling. When empathizing with coworkers, acknowledge that everyone is unique. Think about things from their perspective, understand what they are feeling, what are their motivations? What is driving certain behaviors? Learn to tailor your approach and your messages accordingly. It's also important to empathize with customers. Good data doesn't always mean ship and bad data doesn't always mean don't ship. Empathy allows you to use common sense and factor into the decision the effect a feature will have on customers.
Listen. When trying to relate to someone else, disconnect from work for that brief moment and focus on the other person. Be authentic and take a genuine interest in them. Faking interest in someone is like lip sync'ing on national TV. Bad idea. It will come across as insincere and will backfire on you; making it more difficult to build a relationship in the future.
Mix it up. When exercising if your goal is to build muscle, you can't accomplish that by doing the same thing over and over. You need a variety of exercises to get the desired effect. The same is true with building relationships. If you want to grow the number and depth of your relationships you need to use a variety of tactics. You can do simple things like exchange a common understanding through eye contact or laugh at a joke. Or more personal things like share a story about your family. Time & place are other variables to consider. You can spend 30 seconds in a friendly lync chat or an hour over lunch. The kitchen area is a perfect place to expand your network with short informal chats where you can try to find that common ground
It takes time. If relating to people doesn't come easily, then building many strong relationships (or a strong network) can be an overwhelming task. The reality is that good relationships take time to grow so it's not something you can do overnight anyway. Think of it as a series of small steps that you accomplish one by one and over time you'll start to see your efforts paying off. I am still learning and growing in this area.
Since a lot of our org is in different geo-locations we have the added challenge of relating with people around the world.

I'd love to hear your suggestions regarding this or anything else I discussed above.

## PM SKILLS 1

INCREASE YOUR IMPACT

Before I start - please don't read this to mean that you should do more work.

It means bring more value than you brought yesterday.

There are many things you can do to increase your impact, but here are some suggestions.

Focus and you can be more productive. If you think about it, distraction is the same thing as focus; to lose focus on X you have to focus on Y. So you can go through the whole day feeling like you're focusing and maybe you are, but you might be focusing on the wrong things. In order to be productive you first have to know what your priorities are and then produce work that aligns to them. In my Manage Change blog, I talk about how it's important to have your list of priorities and be able to quickly reprioritize when a new P0 comes in. The best PMs will continually focus on P0s and even though they may be working the same number of hours as other PMs, they make a much greater impact because they aren't distracted working on low priority things.
Leverage your strengths. Everybody has unique strengths. It's surprising to me that many people I talk to are not fully aware of their own strengths, which is probably human nature. But to me, if you are aware of your strengths and how to maximize them you can have a much bigger impact. To identify your strengths, reflect on what activities you do at work that are a predictable part of your performance that you can demonstrate time and time again happily & successfully. Chances are that others in your working groups have different strengths. Don't try to replicate or outdo each other, play to each other's strengths to maximize team impact. For example, if you're an expert in customer research and your dev counterpart is technical, don't try to be technical, let them play that role. Instead you should take the lead on championing the customer. Obviously you should both be proficient in each area but if you partner well, you will be teaching each other over time and will both benefit in the long term. Where this doesn't always work is when there's an abundance of a strength. It is likely that everyone in the working group is technical and contributing but perhaps there is a need for someone to play the role of communicating with a partner team. If you have that strength step up! The team will benefit with this balancing of skills and strengths. After all, you don't get harmony when everyone sings the same note.
Simplify your message. Distill what's important down to the most basic and understandable components. Albert Einstein once said, "any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." For a message to have maximum impact it must be simple, understood and easy to remember. There are a number of tools to help you accomplish this like strategy frameworks, analogies, and whiteboard drawings just to name a few. Most times when I'm trying to simplify a message I can't do it overnight on my own. I test messages by talking to others and refine them over time based on implicit and explicit feedback. So don't wait until your message is perfected to share it. Simplicity is a skill you can get better and better at over time with practice.
Be an intrapreneur. Cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit within our organization is difficult but important. The root of this concept is to think creatively about solutions to challenging problems. Push the boundaries. Don't be constrained by what we've done in the past or what our technology currently enables. The most impactful intrapreneurs undertake something new without being asked to do it, connect their ideas to business objectives and identify ways to create business value. An entrepreneur generally feels a lot more pressure than an intrapreneur operating under a corporate umbrella but put the pressure on yourself; hold yourself accountable for your ideas. Do your own ROI analysis. It will help you know whether your idea is worth your valuable time (and others). And after this if you still believe in it, you'll find it's much easier to convince others.
Overall, if you can increase your impact to the company, the business results and your product you will continue to be very successful. The most successful people I have met in the industry are focused on impact as their top priority. Stick to that and I have every confidence you will have a great career.

In my next blog, I will talk about relating to others. This is a vastly overlooked skill for all professionals, and something I have need to work hard at over my career so I'll share my experience.


### PM SKILLS 3

​One can perform all the standard PM functions and be considered good at their job, but this is not the end game. Great PMs are driven to be better and continuously work at improving themself. Think about a master craftsman, they take years to perfect their craft through thousands and thousands of hours of practice.

In my experience, the truly great PMs approach their job as a craft and work continuously at trying to master it. I continue to aspire to be a great PM, and I know I have many areas of my profession to master still ahead of me. That's part of the joy I have in my career is the knowledge that I have years of learning and experience ahead of me.

One book that made an impression on me related to this is "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell. He examines the factors that contribute to high levels of success using case studies like the Beatles and Bill Gates. Throughout the book the 10,000 rule is mentioned, which claims that the key to success in any field is to a large extent, practicing a specific task for a total of about 10,000 hours. Bill Gates had at least 10,000 of programming experience before he started Microsoft, which was an amazing accomplishment given the scarcity of computers back then. The Beatles toured Europe and perfected their stage presence before they were noticed in the US and shot to stardom.

The morale of this story is that you should not expect to be great overnight, it takes time, focused practice, and confidence in knowing that the work you're putting in now to better yourself as a PM will benefit you in the long term.

I have a few blogs in mind on this topic that I will share over the coming weeks. As always I love to hear feedback as it helps me understand who is reading the blog, and what is on your mind

### PM SKILLS 4

Happy New Year and welcome to 2013. This installment is about managing change.

MANAGE CHANGE

We work in an extremely fast paced industry; things are changing all the time which can be stressful but it is part of the fun and challenges of working as a PM for an online service.

Here are some guidelines to help you navigate this.

Focus on your sphere of influence. Because there's so much change it's important to focus your energy on the elements of it within your control. Narrowing your focus makes change seem less daunting and allows you to put energy into the things that are important for you. For example, if feature team X just cut a feature that you thought was strategically important but it doesn't affect you, don't spend cycles on it. You may not have all the background information and digging around asking questions to the team will create work for others. Or if Google comes out with a new feature and you think other teams aren't responding fast enough, feel free to share information with the feature team or use sfeed but then move on. It is great that we all have product opinions (that's part of what we are paid for), but don't let your passion for products distract you from your job and role in the group. Focus on your features and how you will improve them as quickly as possible.
Communicate early and often. You should be tapped in to changes, make sense of them, and act on them. Take the time to discuss the changes with the people affected early and in a transparent way. To the extent you need buy in, allow others to actively participate in the adaptation of the plan. Avoid surprising people; surprises can create emotional responses and make it difficult to manage through. The key is to triage early, and do it effectivey and transparently.
Know your priorities but be flexible: As part of being organized you should always have your list of priorities and when a new P0 comes in, you should be able to quickly reprioritize if necessary. This requires organization and energy but it's important to take the time and reset expectations if necessary. It's ok to reschedule a meeting that day if you need to, just be transparent and give others as much heads up as possible. Don't cancel 5 minutes in advance. If part of the agenda was to discuss a blocking issue, suggest they drop by for a quick chat and cover the rest of the meeting agenda at another time. The key is to always be prepared. I was a boy scout in my early years, and I learned a lot from that experience - a big part was how to stay dry in wet Irish forests while camping in leaky tents, but the motto of that organization is to "be prepared". Being prepared means always staying on top of things and adapting as changes comes in. This does take effort, but in my experience it makes everything move more swiftly and efficiently.
Be proactive about solving problems: Don't just surface problems, suggest solutions at the same time. If you bring me a problem I will solve it but you may not like my solution and I won't be pleased if you haven't already tried to find one on your own. Good PMs will discover problems and do the legwork to come up with possible solutions before discussing it with their manager. This makes your manager's job easier and you can work together on a solution that will be better informed. The exception to this is when the problem is affecting mission critical work; you should surface it right away while you work on a solution in parallel.  
As always I would love to hear comments and suggestions. This is my point of view on this topic and I'd love to learn from your experience.

Being professional is a pretty general statement which means we work for Microsoft and we have an obligation to the company to do our job to the best of our ability. We need to hold ourselves to formal standards of ethics. Speaking personally, being organized is in many ways related to being professional; generally the more organ ized somebody is the more professional they tend to be portrayed. It is very easy for everyone to be organized. Here are some guidelines that can help you be more professional and organized.

Be consistent and accountable: "Do what you say you're going to do." It sounds simple but it takes effort and accountability to do this day in and day out. Everybody has off days or has to cut corners when you have too many P0s and that's understandable. But if you say you're going to do something, do it, or reset expectations and be transparent. I deeply value this simple demonstration of professionalism.
Be a team player:  As a PM, you are required to work with a lot of different people for you and others to be successful. Be responsible and show up to meetings on time and ready to participate actively and with positve intentions. Listen without guessing what they are trying to say or judging them. Be supportive and flexible; even if you have always done it one way, be willing to try another. And at all times, be respectful. Everything is easier when there's a feeling of mutual respect. This doesn't imply that you should always do what others ask. I expect every PM to have a strong point of view, based on deep data analysis and insights. You should put your point of view forward, but that doesn't mean you have to be the only person speaking at all times. Listen to others - they have a valuable contribution to make, and it is worth listening to them.
Manage your meetings: Program managers are notorious for creating meetings.  Meetings can be highly productive when they run well and can have a variety of negative impacts when they aren't. When you own the meeting, create and circulate an agenda in advance. Identify a clear set of objectives, and invite the minimum audience necessary.  Make use of common techniques (such as the "Parking lot") to acknowledge ideas and keep the meeting on track. Don't let individuals derail your agenda.  Keep the group focused through respectful and open communication.  After the meeting, send out concise notes with clear action items and owners. When appropriate, follow up to check on status. You should also be conscious of your audience's time. If you only need a few minutes schedule a 15 min meeting instead of 30 or 60 minutes.  If your agenda is done early, end the meeting, give people back their time. They need it and you need it!
Optimize your resources: Just because you can build something doesn't mean you should. Be smart about what your developers work on. If you have 5 devs working with you, don't fill them up unnecessarily; plan for what you need and suggest reprioritizing the rest instead of working harder to justify using all 5. Another helpful exercise is to do a simple math equation to see if we should invest in engineering efficiency tools & features: if 10 devs will spend 3 months building features, will their output save engineers more than 30 months of time being more efficient (10x3=30 months)? If not, don't invest. If you don't know, get more input before it's baked into the plan.
That's it for this installation. Have a great holidays, and if you have comments please do leave them here. I valued the comments from the last post, but I mostly received emails. I value the commentary here on the post as it allows us all to discuss this topic together.

Section 1: Doing the Job

Write high quality functional specs:  This is a key aspect of doing job and a vital table stake for a good PM; well written specs enable high quality features. This could be a whole paper on its own but there is already a ton of great documentation on how to write a good spec, I encourage you to take the time to read and learn whatever you can about spec writing. You can also ask your peers and manager for examples of good specs. Your goal should be to write the spec that your team uses as a best practice. It may take time before you get to that level but this is something you can achieve with a desire to learn, awareness, and practice. I believe you should be able to write a decent draft spec in 1 hour if you are deeply knowledgable about your feature, the product, your customer and the environment you are operating. Here are however a couple critical things to consider during spec writing.

Know your customers: As a PM you are the champion for the customer. Whether your customer is an end user, an advertiser or engineers down the hall using Cosmos, know who they are, their pain points, and requirements and design features for them.  Too often features are designed without clarity on who they are meant for. Hone and fine tune your customer focus, it is invaluable. The best PM's are aware and connected to their customers, and they are always aware and not just at planning times.

Be the feature expert. It should go without saying but you should be using your feature every day. If you don't love your feature you may not be on the right area. This is important. Love your feature and use it daily. This includes shipped features as well as dogfood. Doing so allows you to gain customer insight and refine your features accordingly. Don't rely on others to identify and report issues, it's your responsibility. Stay up to date on competitive features and be aware of changes which require action. The action could be anything from adjusting your feature, flighting something similar to gain insights, or communicating that the change has no impact to the current plan. One tip I will give is to demo your feature as often as you can - this helps you pinpoint the key messages and value proposition for your feature, and help you focus. I love to demo, and I believe all PM's should be able to demonstrate their features to everyone they meet.

Know our product and industry: Knowing Bing and our competition is equally as important as being a feature expert.  Use our product and our competitors and get to know each other's strengths and weaknesses. Ask your peers for industry resources and tools to help; try out various news aggregators, rss feeds, apps, favorite websites, etc... Determine which mix and what frequency is right for you to stay informed. As a PM you have to stay one step ahead of the game, so get to know the game.

Love the spec cycle:  Often times in a time crunch I notice PM's tend to skip over one pagers and drafts and go directly to a final spec. By then we're too far into the plan and end up designing features without team consensus that lack customer needs. The spec cycle was designed for a reason.  One pagers are where we evaluate goals, non-goals, metrics, key scenarios, and the customers we are targeting.  Drafts are written in the most challenging part of the planning cycle when there are a lot of moving parts.  Use your draft to flesh out the details and to identity all key open issues. As a PM you should be seeking feedback from as many people as possible. All of these inputs are invaluable, and can hep you make a better product. During one pagers & drafts you should be actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders which should be done via a mix of formal meetings and walking the hallways. By the time you're at a final spec stage it should just be a review of changes and closure of key open issues. Don't design features in the spec review and don't let it be the first time your feature team hears the plan.

Write clearly and concisely:  Specs are living breathing  in documents that get passed around to a variety of audiences.  Make it readable. Anybody should be able to pick up your spec with very little context and develop a strong understanding of your feature, your plan, and what needs to get done. Clearly identify sections and organize them so that people can zero in on the information that is most important to them.  Developers and testers should be able to write their design documents using your spec so include the right level of detail to unblock them. A longer spec doesn't mean higher quality. There is an art to being detailed but concise. Remove extra language and superfluous text. Evaluate each component; does it make sense on its own? Does it add value? If not, remove, reword, or combine it with areas of overlap. Make use of appendixes for non-essential background information.

Love Metrics: Data in all it's lovely forms is vital - you must live and breathe data in your job to be successful. This spans from customer usage data, market sizing data, flight data for your new features, quantitative and qualitative data from user research, performance numbers, revenue, how efficient you are at writing specs, how you use your time, your Klout score and the list goes on! Data is life to a PM and I encourage you to learn as much as you can about data and statistics. It will be invaluable to you and your career.

Be creative and develop your own insights. Cast the net wide for data & information and apply analysis to discover the insights. It takes time to extract your own meaningful insights from the noise so don't start the process of gathering data in the middle of planning, it'll be too late. Start by defining the question(s) you are trying to answer and then gather and explore the data and information. Through the process of performing analysis you may raise additional questions, and it might make sense to partner with Product Management or our Research team to get help designing new research. My advice is to also take time to allow yourself to think of new ideas. My approach is to wallow in data, look at everything I can until my head hurts from so much data, and then I go snowboarding or bike riding and let ideas start to flow. My best ideas come when I am in my most relaxed state, but they are based on deep data and understanding. This is what works for me - try out many things and see what works for you. We are all learning so experiment.

Be a great feature team member:  The most effective teams at Microsoft have a great PM, Dev and Test lead and experienced practioners for each area. Be a partner in managing your feature team.  Get to know your partners in Dev and Test, adapt to their style (e.g. scrum vs. traditional feature team meetings), and build partnerships with each discipline. Look for opportunities to incorporate a variety of opinions but don't hesitate to make the decisions, even when they are the hard ones. The better your relationship is with your dev and test counterparts, the easier it will be to make these tough decisions and resolve conflict. It is very important to collaborate well with your triad or duo members.

Document and share information:  As a program manager your job is to be a great facilitator; you need to communicate and openly share information inside and outside your feature team. Know each audience and modify the information for them accordingly. You should also adapt how and how often you communicate with each. For example, what you communicate to your feature team will be more detailed than what you need to communicate to your GPM, and the cadence of the communication will vary as well.
