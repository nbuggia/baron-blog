title: Chocolate Coffee Bourbon Cake

This cake combines the best flavors of coffee, bourbon and chocolate in a very warm and comforting way (you don’t have a problem if you find bourbon comforting, right?). Very flavorful, perfect for a Fall and Winter cake.

##Ingredients:

Cake

* 1 cup cocoa powder (unsweetened, not Dutch-processed, Ghirardelli is slightly better)
* 1 1/2 cups coffee (brewed, get a 20 oz drip from your best local coffee shop, will leave just enough for you to drink while baking)
* 1/2 cup bourbon (I recommend Makers, and you can add a little bit extra :)
* 1 cup butter (unsalted)
* 2 cups sugar
* 2 cups flour (all purpose)
* 1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 teaspoon almond extract

Frosting Options – there’s a lot of options that go well with this cake, so you’re going to have to make some difficult choices.

* Ice Cream
* Confectioner’s Sugar – tip, use a flour sifter to sprinkle the sugar on top of the cake.
* Whipped cream – add a little bit of sugar. If you’re feeling spunky than you can fold in some molasses, or add a few things to spice it up, like coffee, bourbon, vanilla or almond extract.

##Instructions

* Pre-heat oven to 325
* Coat the inside of your cake pan with butter, dust with cocoa powder
* Medium Bowl – sift:
* 2 cups flower
* 1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Sauce pan – over low heat:
* Melt 1 cup butter
* Add 1 1/2 cup coffee
* Add 1/2 cup bourbon
* Add in Cocoa a little at a time while continuing to stir
* Take off the heat and stir in 2 cups white sugar
* Let sit and cool for about 5 minutes
* In a large mixing bowl – like your kitchenaid bowl…
* Add contents from the sauce pan
* Add 2 eggs
* Add 1 teaspoon vanilla
* Add 1 teaspoon almond extract
* Mix with the paddle on a slow setting
* Slowly add in contents of the medium bowl (flour, etc) while continuing to mix
* Note: mixture will still be a little on the watery side at the end, that’s okay!
* Pour batter into cake pan. If Bundt cake pan, maybe fill 75-80%, as it will rise. (Extra batter makes good cupcakes)
* Cook about 50 minutes in middle rack (until toothpick comes out clean)

Like most cakes, this one tastes best if you give it a day or so to sit and think about what it’s done before you serve it. Make sure to keep it covered to stay moist. Great if served warm, or room temperature with coffee for breakfast.
