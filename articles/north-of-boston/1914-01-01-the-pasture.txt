Title: The Pasture

I'm going out to clean the pasture spring;<br/>
I'll only stop to rake the leaves away<br/>
(And wait to watch the water clear, I may):<br/>
I sha'n't be gone long.—You come too.<br/>
I'm going out to fetch the little calf<br/>
That's standing by the mother. It's so young,<br/>
It totters when she licks it with her tongue.<br/>
I sha'n't be gone long.—You come too.
