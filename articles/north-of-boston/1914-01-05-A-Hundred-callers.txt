Title: A Hundred Callers

Lancaster bore him—such a little town,<br/>
Such a great man. It doesn't see him often<br/>
Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead<br/>
And sends the children down there with their mother<br/>
To run wild in the summer—a little wild.<br/>
Sometimes he joins them for a day or two<br/>
And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.<br/>
They meet him in the general store at night,<br/>
Pre-occupied with formidable mail,<br/>
Rifling a printed letter as he talks.<br/>
They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so:<br/>
Though a great scholar, he's a democrat,<br/>
If not at heart, at least on principle.<br/>
Lately when coming up to Lancaster<br/>
His train being late he missed another train<br/>
And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction<br/>
After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired<br/>
To think of sitting such an ordeal out,<br/>
He turned to the hotel to find a bed.<br/>
"No room," the night clerk said. "Unless——"<br/>
Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps<br/>
And cars that shook and rattle—and one hotel.<br/>
"You say 'unless.'"<br/>
"Unless you wouldn't mind<br/>
Sharing a room with someone else."<br/>
"Who is it?"<br/>
"A man."<br/>
"So I should hope. What kind of man?"<br/>
"I know him: he's all right. A man's a man.<br/>
Separate beds of course you understand."<br/>
The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.<br/>
"Who's that man sleeping in the office chair?<br/>
Has he had the refusal of my chance?"<br/>
"He was afraid of being robbed or murdered.<br/>
What do you say?"<br/>
"I'll have to have a bed."<br/>
The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs<br/>
And down a narrow passage full of doors,<br/>
At the last one of which he knocked and entered.<br/>
"Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room."<br/>
"Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him.<br/>
I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself."<br/>
The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.<br/>
"This will be yours. Good-night," he said, and went.<br/>
"Lafe was the name, I think?"<br/>
"Yes, Layfayette.<br/>
You got it the first time. And yours?"<br/>
"Magoon.<br/>
Doctor Magoon."<br/>
"A Doctor?"<br/>
"Well, a teacher."<br/>
"Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired?<br/>
Hold on, there's something I don't think of now<br/>
That I had on my mind to ask the first<br/>
Man that knew anything I happened in with.<br/>
I'll ask you later—don't let me forget it."<br/>
The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.<br/>
A man? A brute. Naked above the waist,<br/>
He sat there creased and shining in the light,<br/>
Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.<br/>
"I'm moving into a size-larger shirt.<br/>
I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it.<br/>
I just found what the matter was to-night:<br/>
I've been a-choking like a nursery tree<br/>
When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag.<br/>
I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having.<br/>
'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,<br/>
Not liking to own up I'd grown a size.<br/>
Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?"<br/>
The Doctor caught his throat convulsively.<br/>
"Oh—ah—fourteen—fourteen."<br/>
"Fourteen! You say so!<br/>
I can remember when I wore fourteen.<br/>
And come to think I must have back at home<br/>
More than a hundred collars, size fourteen.<br/>
Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.<br/>
They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you.<br/>
What makes you stand there on one leg like that?<br/>
You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you.<br/>
You act as if you wished you hadn't come.<br/>
Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous."<br/>
The Doctor made a subdued dash for it,<br/>
And propped himself at bay against a pillow.<br/>
"Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed.<br/>
You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off."<br/>
"Don't touch me, please—I say, don't touch me, please.<br/>
I'll not be put to bed by you, my man."<br/>
"Just as you say. Have it your own way then.<br/>
'My man' is it? You talk like a professor.<br/>
Speaking of who's afraid of who, however,<br/>
I'm thinking I have more to lose than you<br/>
If anything should happen to be wrong.<br/>
Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat!<br/>
Let's have a show down as an evidence<br/>
Of good faith. There is ninety dollars.<br/>
Come, if you're not afraid."<br/>
"I'm not afraid.<br/>
There's five: that's all I carry."<br/>
"I can search you?<br/>
Where are you moving over to? Stay still.<br/>
You'd better tuck your money under you<br/>
And sleep on it the way I always do<br/>
When I'm with people I don't trust at night."<br/>
"Will you believe me if I put it there<br/>
Right on the counterpane—that I do trust you?"<br/>
"You'd say so, Mister Man.—I'm a collector.<br/>
My ninety isn't mine—you won't think that.<br/>
I pick it up a dollar at a time<br/>
All round the country for the Weekly News,<br/>
Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?"<br/>
"Known it since I was young."<br/>
"Then you know me.<br/>
Now we are getting on together—talking.<br/>
I'm sort of Something for it at the front.<br/>
My business is to find what people want:<br/>
They pay for it, and so they ought to have it.<br/>
Fairbanks, he says to me—he's editor—<br/>
Feel out the public sentiment—he says.<br/>
A good deal comes on me when all is said.<br/>
The only trouble is we disagree<br/>
In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat—<br/>
You know what that is, sort of double-dyed;<br/>
The News has always been Republican.<br/>
Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,'<br/>
Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says,<br/>
'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough:<br/>
It's time you turned around and boosted us.<br/>
You'll have to pay me more than ten a week<br/>
If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft.<br/>
I doubt if I could do it anyway.'"<br/>
"You seem to shape the paper's policy."<br/>
"You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all.<br/>
I almost know their farms as well as they do."<br/>
"You drive around? It must be pleasant work."<br/>
"It's business, but I can't say it's not fun.<br/>
What I like best's the lay of different farms,<br/>
Coming out on them from a stretch of woods,<br/>
Or over a hill or round a sudden corner.<br/>
I like to find folks getting out in spring,<br/>
Raking the dooryard, working near the house.<br/>
Later they get out further in the fields.<br/>
Everything's shut sometimes except the barn;<br/>
The family's all away in some back meadow.<br/>
There's a hay load a-coming—when it comes.<br/>
And later still they all get driven in:<br/>
The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches<br/>
Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees<br/>
To whips and poles. There's nobody about.<br/>
The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking.<br/>
And I lie back and ride. I take the reins<br/>
Only when someone's coming, and the mare<br/>
Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go.<br/>
I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.<br/>
She's got so she turns in at every house<br/>
As if she had some sort of curvature,<br/>
No matter if I have no errand there.<br/>
She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am.<br/>
It's seldom I get down except for meals, though.<br/>
Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,<br/>
All in a family row down to the youngest."<br/>
"One would suppose they might not be as glad<br/>
To see you as you are to see them."<br/>
"Oh,<br/>
Because I want their dollar. I don't want<br/>
Anything they've not got. I never dun.<br/>
I'm there, and they can pay me if they like.<br/>
I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.<br/>
Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink.<br/>
I drink out of the bottle—not your style.<br/>
Mayn't I offer you——?"<br/>
"No, no, no, thank you."<br/>
"Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.—<br/>
And now I'm leaving you a little while.<br/>
You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps—<br/>
Lie down—let yourself go and get some sleep.<br/>
But first—let's see—what was I going to ask you?<br/>
Those collars—who shall I address them to,<br/>
Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?"<br/>
"Really, friend, I can't let you. You—may need them."<br/>
"Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style."<br/>
"But really I—I have so many collars."<br/>
"I don't know who I rather would have have them.<br/>
They're only turning yellow where they are.<br/>
But you're the doctor as the saying is.<br/>
I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me:<br/>
I've just begun the night. You get some sleep.<br/>
I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door<br/>
When I come back so you'll know who it is.<br/>
There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.<br/>
I don't want you should shoot me in the head.<br/>
What am I doing carrying off this bottle?<br/>
There now, you get some sleep."<br/>
He shut the door.<br/>
The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.
