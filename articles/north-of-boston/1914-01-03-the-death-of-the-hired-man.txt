title: The Death of the Hired Man

Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table<br/>
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,<br/>
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage<br/>
To meet him in the doorway with the news<br/>
And put him on his guard. "Silas is back."<br/>
She pushed him outward with her through the door<br/>
And shut it after her. "Be kind," she said.<br/>
She took the market things from Warren's arms<br/>
And set them on the porch, then drew him down<br/>
To sit beside her on the wooden steps.<br/>
"When was I ever anything but kind to him?<br/>
But I'll not have the fellow back," he said.<br/>
"I told him so last haying, didn't I?<br/>
'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'<br/>
What good is he? Who else will harbour him<br/>
At his age for the little he can do?<br/>
What help he is there's no depending on.<br/>
Off he goes always when I need him most.<br/>
'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,<br/>
Enough at least to buy tobacco with,<br/>
So he won't have to beg and be beholden.'<br/>
'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay<br/>
Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.'<br/>
'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.'<br/>
I shouldn't mind his bettering himself<br/>
If that was what it was. You can be certain,<br/>
When he begins like that, there's someone at him<br/>
Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,--<br/>
In haying time, when any help is scarce.<br/>
In winter he comes back to us. I'm done."<br/>

"Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," Mary said.<br/>

"I want him to: he'll have to soon or late."<br/>

"He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.<br/>
When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,<br/>
Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,<br/>
A miserable sight, and frightening, too--<br/>
You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him--<br/>
I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed.<br/>
Wait till you see."<br/>

"Where did you say he'd been?"<br/>

"He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,<br/>
And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.<br/>
I tried to make him talk about his travels.<br/>
Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off."<br/>

"What did he say? Did he say anything?"

"But little."

"Anything? Mary, confess<br/>
He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me."

"Warren!"

" ;But did he? I just want to know."

"Of course he did. What would you have him say?<br/>
Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man<br/>
Some humble way to save his self-respect.<br/>
He added, if you really care to know,<br/>
He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.<br/>
That sounds like something you have heard before?<br/>
Warren, I wish you could have heard the way<br/>
He jumbled everything. I stopped to look<br/>
Two or three times--he made me feel so queer--<br/>
To see if he was talking in his sleep.<br/>
He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember--<br/>
The boy you had in haying four years since.<br/>
He's finished school, and teaching in his college.<br/>
Silas declares you'll have to get him back.<br/>
He says they two will make a team for work:<br/>
Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!<br/>
The way he mixed that in with other things.<br/>
He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft<br/>
On education--you know how they fought<br/>
All through July under the blazing sun,<br/>
Silas up on the cart to build the load,<br/>
Harold along beside to pitch it on."<br/>

"Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot."<br/>

"Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.<br/>
You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger!<br/>
Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.<br/>
After so many years he still keeps finding<br/>
Good arguments he sees he might have used.<br/>
I sympathise. I know just how it feels<br/>
To think of the right thing to say too late.<br/>
Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.<br/>
He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying<br/>
He studied Latin like the violin<br/>
Because he liked it--that an argument!<br/>
He said he couldn't make the boy believe<br/>
He could find water with a hazel prong--<br/>
Which showed how much good school had ever done him.<br/>
He wanted to go over that. But most of all<br/>
He thinks if he could have another chance<br/>
To teach him how to build a load of hay----"<br/>

"I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.<br/>
He bundles every forkful in its place,<br/>
And tags and numbers it for future reference,<br/>
So he can find and easily dislodge it<br/>
In the unloading. Silas does that well.<br/>
He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.<br/>
You never see him standing on the hay<br/>
He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself."<br/>

"He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be<br/>
Some good perhaps to someone in the world.<br/>
He hates to see a boy the fool of books.<br/>
Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,<br/>
And nothing to look backward to with pride,<br/>
And nothing to look forward to with hope,<br/>
So now and never any different."<br/>

Part of a moon was falling down the west,<br/>
Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.<br/>
Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw<br/>
And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand<br/>
Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,<br/>
Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,<br/>
As if she played unheard the tenderness<br/>
That wrought on him beside her in the night.<br/>
"Warren," she said, "he has come home to die:<br/>
You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."<br/>

"Home," he mocked gently.<br/>

"Yes, what else but home?<br/>
It all depends on what you mean by home.<br/>
Of course he's nothing to us, any more<br/>
Than was the hound that came a stranger to us<br/>
Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."<br/>

"Home is the place where, when you have to go there,<br/>
They have to take you in."<br/>

"I should have called it<br/>
Something you somehow haven't to deserve."<br/>

Warren leaned out and took a step or two,<br/>
Picked up a little stick, and brought it back<br/>
And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.<br/>
"Silas has better claim on us you think<br/>
Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles<br/>
As the road winds would bring him to his door.<br/>
Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.<br/>
Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich,<br/>
A somebody--director in the bank."

"He never told us that."

"We know it though."

"I think his brother ought to help, of course.<br/>
I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right<br/>
To take him in, and might be willing to--<br/>
He may be better than appearances.<br/>
But have some pity on Silas. Do you think<br/>
If he'd had any pride in claiming kin<br/>
Or anything he looked for from his brother,<br/>
He'd keep so still about him all this time?"

"I wonder what's between them."

"I can tell you.<br/>
Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him--<br/>
But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.<br/>
He never did a thing so very bad.<br/>
He don't know why he isn't quite as good<br/>
As anyone. He won't be made ashamed<br/>
To please his brother, worthless though he is."

"I can't think Si ever hurt anyone."

"No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay<br/>
And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.<br/>
He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.<br/>
You must go in and see what you can do.<br/>
I made the bed up for him there to-night.<br/>
You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken.<br/>
His working days are done; I'm sure of it."

"I'd not be in a hurry to say that."

"I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.<br/>
But, Warren, please remember how it is:<br/>
He's come to help you ditch the meadow.<br/>
He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.<br/>
He may not speak of it, and then he may.<br/>
I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud<br/>
Will hit or miss the moon."

It hit the moon.<br/>
Then there were three there, making a dim row,<br/>
The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.<br/>

Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,<br/>
Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.

"Warren," she questioned.

"Dead," was all he answered.
